# Minecraft-Hand-Signs
I utilize an AI (Google's Mediapipe Library) in Python that lets you play Minecraft using hand signs. This program tracks your hand movements using AI and translates them into in-game actions. In short, you can do anything a mouse and keyboard can do. 

How to use:
1. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the Handcontrol.py file. (Do not forget to install the libraries)

Programmer's note:
I know it's quite confusing to use it, I'm planning to make a whole complete guide in the future. (  still busy for college :(  )
